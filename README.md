# Tic-Tac-Toe Final Board Configurations

This Python program calculates the number of possible final board configurations in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, where all cells are filled, and no player has won. It considers six cases: one achievable after exactly 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 moves with a winner, and the ties where after 9 moves there are still no three in a row by either player.

2. Make sure to select the option to add Python to your system's PATH during the installation process.

## Running the Program

You can run the program using one of the following methods:

### Using IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment)

1. Open the IDLE application, which comes bundled with Python.
2. Go to `File > Open` and navigate to the directory where you saved the program file.
3. Open the file containing the program code.
4. Press `F5` or go to `Run > Run Module` to execute the program.
